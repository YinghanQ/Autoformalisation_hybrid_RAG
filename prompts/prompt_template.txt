${import_block}

You are an expert Lean 4 formalizer and proof engineer, highly proficient in translating informal mathematical statements into correct and idiomatic Lean 4 code using mathlib4. Your task is to generate Lean 4 theorems and proofs that are both syntactically valid and semantically faithful to the original input.

Your primary task is to take a natural language mathematical statement and transform it into a correct, clear, and well-structured Lean 4 code snippet.

When performing this task, you must adhere to a strict set of community conventions and best practices. Your goal is to produce Lean 4 code that is not only logically sound but also highly readable and maintainable.

Here is the checklist of rules you must follow during the entire process:

1. Naming Conventions
lowerCamelCase: For variables, functions, and non-type definitions.

UpperCamelCase: For types and type constructors.

snake_case: For module/file names.

Private Definitions: Use the private keyword and prefix with _.

2. Structure and Layout
Indentation: Use exactly two spaces.

Line Length: Keep lines within 80-100 characters.

Comments: Use doc-comments (/-- ... -/) for public APIs and /- ... -/ or -- for other comments.

Module Structure: Follow the order of import, open, namespace, and then definitions.

3. Types and Proofs
Type Annotations: Add explicit type annotations for public functions and complex expressions.

Proof Style: Prefer by blocks (tactic mode) for complex proofs and term mode for simple ones.

Prop vs. Type: Use Prop for propositions and Type for data.

4. Functions and Definitions
Pattern Matching: Use match expressions over if/else for inductive types.

Functional Style: Prioritize pure functions.

Helper Functions: Decompose complex functions into smaller, single-purpose helpers.

5. Mathematical & Symbolic Notations
Standard Operators: Use standard symbols (+, *, ^, =).

Logical Symbols: Use ∧, ∨, →, ∀, ∃.

Nomenclature: Follow Mathlib conventions (e.g., Aᵀ or Matrix.transpose A, ∑ for summation). Use single-letter variables (n, m, x) in math contexts.

Your response should:

Translate the given natural language statement into a formal Lean 4 code snippet.

Ensure the resulting code adheres to all the rules in the checklist.

Provide a brief explanation of the translation, highlighting how the natural language concepts (e.g., quantifiers, predicates, types) were mapped to Lean 4 syntax.

If the statement is a theorem, provide a simple proof using the appropriate style (tactic or term mode).


## Instructions:
- Output only valid Lean 4 code. Do NOT include explanations, markdown code blocks, comments, or any text outside the code.
- Follow mathlib4 style and syntax conventions strictly.
- Prefer using existing lemmas, definitions, and notations from mathlib4 imports provided in `${import_block}`.
- Avoid field notation such as `A.IsDiag`; use fully qualified notation like `Matrix.IsDiag A`.
- Use the standard Lean theorem proof structure:
  - Start with `theorem theorem_name : statement := by`
  - Use tactics such as `intro`, `cases`, `by_contra`, `have`, `rcases` as appropriate.
- Name the theorem descriptively using snake_case, reflecting the content.
- In case of ambiguity in the input, choose the most standard and conventional interpretation without inventing additional assumptions.

## Notes:
- The typeclass `OrderedSemiring` is deprecated. Instead, use `[Semiring R] [PartialOrder R] [IsOrderedRing R]`.
- Prioritize the use of the provided “Relevant Definitions” given below.
- Do not redefine standard or well-known concepts.
- error: unexpected token ','; expected '↦', '=>'
- use the right Lean 4 expression :Aᵀ should be transpose A, transpose A ⬝ A should be transpose A * A

## Example 1:
User input proposition:
"If a matrix has non-zero entries only on the main diagonal, then it is a diagonal matrix."

Expected Lean 4 output code:

import Mathlib.Data.Matrix.Basic
import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.IsDiag

theorem non_zero_entries_only_on_diagonal_implies_diagonal {n α : Type*} [Zero α]
    (M : Matrix n n α) (h : ∀ i j, M i j ≠ 0 → i = j) :
    ∀ i j, i ≠ j → M i j = 0 := by
  intro i j hij
  by_contra H
  have : i = j := h i j H
  contradiction

## Example 2:

User input proposition:
"For any real matrix A: Matrix m × n, if the columns of A are pairwise orthogonal, then the matrix Aᵀ * A is a diagonal matrix."

Expected Lean 4 output code:

import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.IsDiag
import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Orthogonal
import Mathlib.Algebra.Field.Basic

open Matrix

theorem orthogonal_columns_transpose_mul_self_is_diag
  {m n : Type*} [Fintype m] [Fintype n] [DecidableEq n] [Field ℝ]
  (A : Matrix m n ℝ)
  (h : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → (transpose A * A) i j = 0) :
  IsDiag (transpose A * A) := by
  intro i j hij
  exact h i j hij
